This is my implementation of a simple Minimal Limit Order Book.

It implements the basic operations: Add, Delete, Modify and Match Orders.

It also implements a small profiler to track the timings of these functions

In main.cpp there is a small test which showcases how the MLOB works and also uses the Profiler to output some timing data
